terminal-into
=============

A Mac and Linux based tutorial for using built-in shell commands

## Introduction

The terminal is a text-based way to control a computer. Because it was created early on in computing it can be unintuitive and a little daunting. However, it is a seriously powerful tool and is probably most widely used tool by computer science professionals. 

Before we dive to much into this:
* Make sure you are using a Mac or Linux computer (this guide doesn't apply to Windows)
* Open a new terminal

The focus here is to introduce navigation in a shell environment. (Note: shell, terminal, and console are used interchangably here)
